Replace `<script_name>` with the actual name of your Python script file.

## How It Works
- The application starts by loading the medical insurance data from a CSV file.
- Users can manipulate various insurance parameters via sliders to reflect different profiles.
- Clicking the 'Predict Insurance Charge' button will display the predicted insurance charge based on the input values.

## Notes
- The application expects the CSV file to have specific columns as per the model's training data.
- Ensure that all dependencies are properly installed and that the CSV file is correctly formatted.

## Correction Note
If you notice any discrepancies in the class names or any runtime errors, ensure that the class name in your script matches the one used when creating the application instance:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = MedicalInsurancePriceApp(root)
    root.mainloop()
